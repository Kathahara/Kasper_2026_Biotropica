## Abstract

Sunda clouded leopard conservation requires understanding key species traits. Using photo-identification, we estimated lifespans from minimum residence times, documenting the oldest wild individual known to date – a 6.51-year-old female. We discuss methodological limitations in female detectability and transient individuals in the population and propose recommendations to improve future monitoring.
